        //present image picker in front of user so he can use it. Top one allows you to place another view controller on the screen. Completion is to ask you what you want to run but here you can say nil since it's optional. IE you dont care what happens after it's done
        //need to go to info.plist and select a new type, privacy - photo library usage. Need to give a message to the user why you need their info. Value will be a popup. This is to allow you to use.
    }
    func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [String : Any]) { //didfinishpickingmedia to say what happens when the person selects the image!. Here we get a hash called "info" on what image they selected. Can see they give a dictionary with string for key and any for value
        let image = info[UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage] as! UIImage //calling the value of "info" at the Original Image (ie the image they selected). As! UIImage to specify that this will give us back a UIImage. UIImage is the data around an image file that we can put into an image view
        screenshotImageView.image = image //setting the imageview image to the image we got from the image picker
        imagePicker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil) //if you don't dismiss there'll be an error so you have to get rid of the imagePicker controller
